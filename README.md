# OpenVED.org

Welcome to **OpenVED.org** — an open-source organization dedicated to empowering developers, designers, and innovators through **collaborative coding**, **community learning**, and **inclusive contributions**.

## Our Mission

At OpenVED.org, our goal is to **build better technology together**. We believe that open source thrives when knowledge is shared freely and people come together across languages, tech stacks, and backgrounds to:

- **Contribute to open source projects**
- **Teach and learn coding collaboratively**
- **Support developers at all skill levels**
- **Build meaningful, real-world software**

## What We Do

- **Open Source Projects**: We maintain and contribute to community-first projects in web development, AI, DevOps, mobile apps, and more.
- **Workshops & Tutorials**: We host regular events and write guides to help everyone understand modern development tools and practices.
- **Mentorship & Collaboration**: New to open source? We’ll help you make your first PR and grow your skills.
